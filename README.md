# Pen Practice

Some people like me still need to improve their handwriting, despite their old age. Pen Practice is a website to print worksheets to convert that menacing writing into something a tad prettier.

The font list comes from Google Fonts, and the standard Google Fonts stylesheet-based loading is used to load these fonts.

The app is written with Svelte. You'll need to `npm install` to grab the build tools, then run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To start a live development environment at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

To create an optimised production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then start the app with `npm run start`.
